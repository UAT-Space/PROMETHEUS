These files were obtained from github from their offical repos; This was before
I found 'Target packages -> Hardware Handling -> Firmware -> rpi-wifi-firmware'
in buildroot's menuconfig, I refuse to remedy this because it works.

In the future you should enable rpi-wifi-firmware and delete 'lib/firmware'
from the overlay directory.
